# Git Dammit! Demo repository

This is a repository for demo purposes only, to be used with https://github.com/mghignet/git-dammit-talk
The aim is only to manipulate Git, so if the code does not make sense at all, well it's okay.

## Moving cars!
Actually, the code may make a little sense (just a little though).
It displays cars!

To use it, please install Node.js (at least version 6.0.0) and run:
```
node src/index.js
```
